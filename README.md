This project was a reintroduction to HTML & CSS that focused on understanding how to use things like `float: [left/right]` to acheive a certain layout, add media and an `iframe` and use semantic HTML.

The focus was not on the actual design aspect, but some efforts have been made as practise for the future. FontAwesome is used through a Content Delivery Network (CDN).


## Starting from blank
To start with, I blocked out my major HTML elements and one or two nested elements in each of those (if any). Then I moved to my stylesheet and gave each element a border to help visualise the layout, spacing and relationships between elements better, which I recommend. If you've used Blender, think of it like a wireframe!

Then it was just a matter of adding more detail (tags, styles, layout), but it all starts from simple block forms. I reckon I will be using this process, or a modification of it, throughout.
